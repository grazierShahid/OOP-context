# SOLID Principles Tutorial Guide

## Overview
This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to understanding SOLID principles through practical examples and clear explanations. The content is structured to facilitate both learning and reference.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Core Concepts (context.md)
- Detailed explanation of each SOLID principle
- Real-world analogies for better understanding
- Practical examples showing violations and proper implementations
- Clear explanations of benefits and use cases

### 2. Practical Implementations
- **Java Examples** (example.java)
  - Implementation of all SOLID principles
  - Practical use cases and demonstrations
  - Well-commented code for learning purposes

- **Go Examples** (example.go)
  - Same principles implemented in Go
  - Language-specific adaptations
  - Demonstrates language-agnostic nature of SOLID

### 3. Reference Guide (FAQ.md)
- Common interview questions and answers
- Comparisons between different principles
- Common misconceptions clarified
- Implementation challenges and solutions
- Best practices and guidelines
