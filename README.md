# OOP-context: Object-Oriented Programming, SOLID - Tutorial Guide

## Project Overview
This tutorial series provides a comprehensive guide to mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principles. The content is structured in two main sections, with each section following a consistent format for easy learning.

## Tutorial Structure

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (`/1. Object-Oriented-Programming/`)
The foundational concepts of OOP are covered through:
- **Core Concepts** (`context.md`) - Explains OOP fundamentals with real-world analogies
- **Code Examples** - Implementations in both Java and Go
- **FAQ Guide** - Common questions and misconceptions addressed
- **Implementation Guide** - Step-by-step tutorials and best practices

### 2. SOLID Principles (`/2. SOLID Principles/`)
Building on OOP knowledge with advanced design principles:
- **Core Concepts** (`context.md`) - Each SOLID principle explained in detail
- **Code Examples** - Practical implementations showing proper usage
- **FAQ Guide** - Interview questions and common challenges
- **Implementation Guide** - Real-world applications and patterns
