Now We Know About OOP and SOLID Principles, So Let’s Understand How They Help in Designing a System With Design Patterns...

When we design a system, our main goal is simple: keep the code easy to read, easy to maintain, and easy to change when new requirements come. OOP gives us the basic building blocks to do this — Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. Think of OOP like the “grammar” of our code language. But just knowing grammar doesn’t make a great story — we also need structure and proven ways to solve common problems. That’s where Design Patterns come in. Patterns are like ready-made solutions for problems we see again and again.

Take Encapsulation for example. It hides the internal details of a class and only exposes what is needed. This is super useful in many design patterns. Think about the Factory Pattern — we don’t need to know which exact object is created, we just call create_object() and get it ready to use. This keeps client code clean. Without OOP’s encapsulation, we would be exposing too many details and every small change would break many places in the system.

Now look at Inheritance and Polymorphism. They are the power behind patterns like Strategy, Observer, and Decorator. With polymorphism, we can program against interfaces instead of exact classes (this is also SOLID’s Dependency Inversion Principle). For example, in Strategy Pattern, we can swap algorithms easily. If tomorrow business says: “Add a new Payment Method,” we just create a new class that implements the interface. No need to touch old code — everything still works. This gives us flexibility and confidence to change the system without breaking it.

And don’t forget Composition. Design patterns often say “Prefer Composition Over Inheritance.” Why? Because composition gives more flexibility. Example: Decorator Pattern uses composition to add extra behavior at runtime without changing the original class. OOP makes this possible because one object can hold another object and call its methods — this is how we build layers of behavior dynamically.

So, we can think like this:

- OOP = The Raw Materials (Class, Object, Encapsulation, etc.)

- SOLID = The Rules (How to use OOP in a clean way)

- Design Patterns = The Recipes (Proven solutions we can follow to solve problems)

When we use all three together, our code becomes scalable, flexible, and easy to evolve as the product grows. This is why OOP is the base for almost all design patterns — it gives us the tools we need to apply those patterns properly.
